Ukraine’s interior ministry reported that the country was under attack from cruise and ballistic missiles, with Russia appearing to target infrastructure near major cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Dnipro.\r\n\r\nExplosions from artillery rockets lit up the night sky as shelling began near Mariupol, video showed. A senior adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said that it appeared Russian troops may soon move on Kharkiv, which is about 20 miles from the border.

Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.”\r\n\r\nBy mid-afternoon on Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems.\r\n\r\nUkrainian authorities said Russia had carried out 203 attacks and that fighting was raging across almost the entire territory.\r\n\r\nMilitary sources in Ukraine said 20 Russian helicopters and Mi-8 aircraft had landed paratroopers at Hostomel airport in the Kyiv region, where forces from both sides were fighting for control. They said Ukrainian forces had killed 50 Russian troops, destroyed four Russian tanks, and downed six Russian planes and four helicopters. Zelenskiy also said Ukrainian forces were fighting to prevent Russian troops capturing Chernobyl. It was later reported that the Russians now held the former nuclear plant.\r\n\r\nThe early hours of the invasion appeared to have claimed dozens of civilian lives in Ukraine. According to the authorities, 18 people were killed in a missile attack in the southern Odesa region, six people were killed in the town of Brovary, near Kyiv, and four people were killed and 10 injured after an “occupier’s shell” hit a hospital in the city of Vuhledar in Donetsk.\r\n', 'Russian forces have unleashed an attack of Ukraine on the orders of Vladimir Putin, who announced a “special military operation” at dawn, amid warnings from world leaders that it could spark the biggest war in Europe since 1945.\r\n\r\nWithin minutes of Putin’s short televised address, at about 5am Ukrainian time, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv.', '2022-02-24', '14:10:00', 1, 1),

The scheme, part of the State strategy to combat climate change, aims to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030.\r\n\r\nLandlords can end tenancies if they plan to carry out a “substantial refurbishment” of the property. There is also an exemption available from the rules limiting rent increases in rent pressure zones (RPZ) if the landlord plans to make a “substantial change” to the property, including substantially improving its Building Energy Rating.\r\n\r\nSinn Féin TD Imelda Munster raised the issue during Thursday’s committee meeting and asked the RTB representatives if the new retrofit scheme will appeal to landlords as a means of circumventing RPZ regulations.\r\n\r\nRTB chairman Tom Dunne said it is a “very good question because clearly one of the reasons why you can ask a tenant to leave the accommodation is if the accommodation is in need of refurbishment”.\r\n\r\nHe said: “If you give incentives to people who own property to bring the standards of insulation etc up. . . clearly a number of landlords may choose to undertake that work and in order to undertake it they may need to get the tenant out of the property. So that’s one of the issues that might arise because of that.”\r\n\r\nMs Munster suggested it could add to the crisis in the rental sector and asked if the RTB had come across this issue as a result of previous retrofitting schemes.\r\n\r\nMr Dunne said this had not been researched. “I don’t think there has been a scheme as extensive as this. There were always incentives from the sustainability organisations to incentivise people to insulate their houses. . . and I’ve never come across even anecdotally that being a problem. What I’m saying is it might become a problem now.”\r\n\r\nMr Dunne said the issue came up at a recent meeting with Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and “it is something that one needs to be thinking about”.\r\n\r\nThe RTB later told the Irish Times that landlords can end tenancies if they want to carry out significant refurbishment but they must satisfy a number of criteria.\r\n\r\nThese include stating if planning permission is required and the duration of the proposed works, and the notice of termination must contain a certificate from a registered professional stating that the proposed work poses a threat to a tenant’s health and safety.\r\n\r\nIt said that once the works are complete the landlord must offer the property back to the original tenant.\r\n\r\nSenior officials from the RTB also faced questions over an information technology project - a tenancy management system - that was delayed and more than doubled in cost to €6.9 million.\r\n', 'The Government’s new retrofitting scheme could become a “problem” as landlords may use it as a reason to end tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) has told the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, announced earlier this month, is to provide people with grants to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.

Ms McPhillips said that “should the parties be unable to reach a final agreement by April 30th, 2022, the matter will be referred back to the Labour Court for a definitive recommendation”.\r\n\r\nShe said engagements at the WRC led to an agreement being reached “on a mechanism to move the matter under dispute forward over the next two months. As part of this agreement, the Association of Garda Chief Superintendents and the Association of Garda Superintendents undertook to suspend their industrial action.\r\n\r\n“As a result, it was agreed that the superintendents and chief superintendents will return, on a phased, balanced and realistic basis, to carrying out the activities which they had characterised as being outside of their core duties.\r\n\r\n“This includes a return to carrying out relevant Gsoc investigations once again.”\r\n\r\nMs McPhillips added “This department will continue to work to ensure that a final resolution to the dispute is achieved.”\r\n\r\nThe senior Garda officers stopped carrying out investigations on behalf of Garda watchdog Gsoc last July as they began working “in strict compliance with the core duties of the Garda code”.\r\n\r\nThe move was part of a protest at the failure to implement an increase in an existing weekly allowance paid to compensate officers for having to be available outside of regular working hours. The increase had been recommended as part of a review.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary investigations\r\nEarlier this month Gsoc told the PAC the dispute has impacted the completion of some disciplinary investigations within the required time lines and “resulted in delays outside the control of Gsoc”.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said Russia’s defence ministry had sent Ukraine an urgent message warning of a high risk to flight safety, due to the use of weapons and military equipment from 0045 GMT, and asked Ukraine’s air traffic control to stop flights.\r\n\r\nWebsites, which before the escalation had shown intelligence-gathering flights over or near Ukraine as the West showcased support by transmitting detectable signals in recent weeks, showed empty space on Thursday as aircraft left and Ukraine was declared a conflict zone.\r\n\r\nEarly morning airline traffic skirted the whole country in crowded corridors to the north and west.\r\n\r\nAn El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Toronto made a sudden U-turn out of Ukraine’s airspace around the time of its closure, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed. A LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Kyiv turned back.\r\n\r\nBefore Ukraine’s announcement, Britain, Canada, France, Italy and the US told their airlines to avoid certain airspace above eastern Ukraine and Crimea but stopped short of a total ban.\r\n\r\nLondon-listed budget carrier Wizz Air said it was halting operations out of Ukraine in an announcement released after Ukraine shut its airspace. Germany’s Lufthansa and KLM suspended flights days earlier.\r\n\r\nExpansion plan\r\nTwo Ukrainian airlines said last week they had faced problems securing insurance for some flights, as foreign carriers began avoiding the airspace amid Russia’s military build up on the border.\r\n\r\nRyanair mainly serves airports in the west of Ukraine, but has no aircraft or crew based in the country. However, the carrier said last month it could base up to 20 planes in Ukraine over the next few years if Russia did not invade. It has also been planning to fly 230 flights weekly flights from three Ukrainian airports this summer.\r\n\r\nAlexander Paterson, an analyst with UK stockbroking firm Peel Hunt, estimated in a report that some 20 per cent of Ryanair’s revenues come from Central and Eastern Europe, meaning that an escalation in tensions in the region “could be problematic”.\r\n\r\n“We sincerely regret and apologies for these unprecedented disruptions and any inconvenience that they will inevitably cause to our Ukrainian customers,” Ryanair said.', 'Ryanair said on Thursday that it has suspended flights to and from Ukraine for at least 14 days after local authorities closed airspace to civilian aircraft overnight as Russia invaded its western neighbour by land, air and sea.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Irish carrier said that it “remains committed” to its routes serving Ukraine and will restore flights as soon as it is safe to do so.\r\n\r\n“Due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace overnight, and the apparent invasion by Russian forces, all Ryanair flights to/from Ukraine have been suspended for at least the next 14 days,” Ryanair said in a statement.', '2022-02-27', '12:15:00', 4, 3),

Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) called on Kotick to “negotiate in good faith with the workers and suspend any efforts to undermine your employees’ legal right to form a union and collectively bargain.”\r\n\r\nBaldwin’s letter arrived a day after the conclusion of a National Labor Relations Board hearing between Activision-owned Raven Software, based in Wisconsin, and a group of that company’s quality assurance testers who are attempting to unionize their department. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, was also sent to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Microsoft recently announced its intentions to purchase Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion, pending approval by the Federal Trade Commission.\r\n\r\nBaldwin wrote in the letter that she “will be following the proceedings at the National Labor Relations Board and Raven Software closely. I urge you and the management at Raven Software to remain neutral in the coming NLRB election in order to allow your employees to decide their representatives for themselves.”\r\n\r\nActivision Blizzard confirmed receipt of the letter but declined to comment. Microsoft did not respond to comment.\r\n\r\nBaldwin has a track record of being pro-labor. She’s a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), and has introduced pro-worker legislation in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe letter ramps up public pressure on Activision Blizzard after it elected not to voluntarily recognize the union, dubbed the Game Workers Alliance, in late January sending the proceedings to a review by the NLRB.\r\n\r\nActivision Blizzard employees and management clash over union process in Zoom hearing\r\n\r\nCornell professor of labor and employment law Risa Lieberwitz said that even though Sen. Baldwin “does not have direct power” in the unionization situation, her letter could “bring more public attention to Activision’s conduct.”\r\n\r\n“It is significant for a U.S. Senator to send a strong message that Activision Blizzard should conduct themselves in a way that respects workers’ rights to unionize,” Lieberwitz said. “This could influence public opinion about Activision Blizzard, which can have a negative impact on the company’s public image and reputation.”\r\n\r\nIn the four-day hearing with the NLRB that ended Tuesday, Activision Blizzard and the workers argued over whether workers should be allowed to form a so-called “micro union” of several dozen employees inside the quality assurance department. Shortly after the department announced its intentions to unionize, Activision Blizzard announced the testers would be redistributed around the company and embedded into different departments, a fact Baldwin noted in her letter. The company also argued that all Raven employees should be allowed to vote on unionization. A larger group would require more employee votes in order to unionize, whereas the testers had already reached the needed majority of votes within their department.\r\n\r\nMuch of the testimony discussed employees’ duties and whether quality assurance testing was distinct enough from other departments. Activision argued that the testers are part of the development and production process, including getting to contribute ideas to “Call of Duty” games. It pointed to how, as of late January, testers have been moved across different departments in Raven, including animation, art, audio, design, engineering and live operations production.\r\n\r\nA ruling from the NLRB is expected in the next several months.\r\n\r\n‘Scorched earth’ and big profits: How embattled gaming titan Bobby Kotick outlasts his opponents\r\n\r\nOne Raven Software quality assurance tester told The Washington Post she hopes the hearing proves to the NLRB that company leaders “really don’t know much of anything about QA’s daily duties.”\r\n\r\n“They seem so far removed from the actual day-to-day activities,” she said, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation. “QA testers still primarily test the game, that is their main job description and what people applied for. But asking them to not only test the game but even working alongside developers while expecting to keep them at their current pay rate is beyond disappointing to hear from our leadership.”\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard comes with additional stipulations around workers’ unionization efforts. Activision Blizzard is not allowed to voluntarily recognize a union or to enter into a collective bargaining agreement without Microsoft’s approval, according to a recent SEC filing from Activision.\r\n\r\nLieberwitz said that regardless of Microsoft stipulating it must approve Activision workers’ unionization effort as part of the acquisition terms, both companies still have to follow the law, which includes NLRB rulings.\r\n\r\n“If the NLRB decides that a bargaining unit of QA employees is appropriate — as petitioned for by the CWA — then Activision Blizzard and Microsoft must comply with the NLRB ruling,” she said.', 'In a letter to Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick Wednesday, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) called on Kotick to “negotiate in good faith with the workers and suspend any efforts to undermine your employees’ legal right to form a union and collectively bargain.”', '2022-02-28', '13:15:00', 3, 5),

could also result in it being penalised by the United Nations-linked organisation which is responsible for the administration of international aviation law.\r\n\r\nAustralia and the Netherlands have been seeking compensation and an apology from the Russian Federation for the MH17 disaster that saw 298 people, including 38 Australians, killed when it was shot down over Ukraine in 2014.\r\n\r\nAustralia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, and attorney general, Michaelia Cash, announced on Monday that Australia would be launching joint action with the Netherlands under Article 84 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, and will allege that Russia is in breach of the Chicago Convention that underpins aviation law.\r\n\r\n“We have maintained since May 2018 that the Russian Federation is responsible under international law for the downing of flight MH17,” Payne said in a statement ahead of Monday evening’s announcement in Sydney.\r\n\r\n“Today’s joint action by Australia and the Netherlands is a major step forward in both countries’ fight for truth, justice and accountability for this horrific act of violence.”\r\n\r\n“The Russian Federation’s refusal to take responsibility for its role in the downing of flight MH17 is unacceptable and the Australian government has always said that it will not exclude any legal options in our pursuit of justice.”\r\n\r\nAustralia and the Netherlands will rely on what they say is the “overwhelming evidence” that the flight was shot down by a Russian Buk-Telar surface-to-air missile system, which was transported from Russia to an agricultural field in the east of Ukraine on the morning of 17 July 2014.\r\n\r\nAt the time the area was under the control of Russian-backed separatists.\r\n\r\nThe two countries will also present evidence that the missile system belonged to the Russian Federation’s 53rd anti-aircraft military brigade, and was accompanied by a trained Russian military crew.\r\n\r\nOnly the trained Russian crew of the Buk-Telar, or someone acting under their instruction, direction or control could have launched the missile system, which was returned to the Russian Federation shortly after the downing of flight MH17.\r\n\r\nThe legal action is in addition to the Dutch national prosecution of four suspects for their individual criminal responsibility in the downing of the flight: three Russians, Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy, Oleg Pulatov, and a Ukrainian, Leonid Kharchenko.\r\n\r\nAn international investigation found that the men did not “push the button” on the missile system themselves, but had brought the anti-aircraft system to eastern Ukraine and were the link between the Moscow-backed separatist Donetsk People’s Republic and Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the statement, Payne said the Russian Federation needed to be held to account for its breaches of international law, particularly in light of the invasion of Ukraine.\r\n\r\n“Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of its aggression underscores the need to continue our enduring efforts to hold Russia to account for its blatant violation of international law and the UN charter, including threats to Ukraine’s sovereignty and airspace,” Payne said.\r\n\r\n“While we cannot take away the grief of those whose loved ones died as a result of Russia’s actions, the Australian government will pursue every available avenue to ensure Russia is held to account so that this horrific act never happens again.”\r\n\r\nAt a press conference in Sydney, Payne told reporters Australia could “consider” withdrawing the action if Russia is “prepared to return to [the] negotiating table … but we have seen no sign of good faith from Russia on that for some time.”\r\n\r\nAustralia and the Netherlands informed the Russian Federation in 2018 that the two countries held Russia responsible under international law for its role in the bringing down of MH17, despite the Kremlin’s repeated denials.\r\n\r\nAustralia’s then foreign minister, Julie Bishop, at the time called on Russia to “enter into negotiations to open up a dialogue

Williams had found that an insufficiently diverse Home Office leadership team had “contributed to some of the errors in thinking which gave rise to the Windrush scandal itself”. Although some steps had been taken to address this issue, “success remains elusive and a much more dynamic approach is needed”, she said.\r\n\r\nWilliams was particularly concerned by the slow pace of the compensation programme. A small poll of applicants to the Windrush compensation scheme conducted by Williams found that 76% said they had not been treated respectfully by Home Office staff, and that 97% said that they did not trust the Home Office to deliver on its commitments. About 386 claimants have waited more than a year for their claims to be resolved, 179 of whom have been waiting more than 18 months.\r\n\r\n“I met people who were still in severe financial and personal difficulties two years on from my original review. Some were unable to find work after time away from the job market. Others were in temporary accommodation, having to live with families or facing eviction because of unpaid bills. Some were in serious debt,” she wrote.\r\n\r\n“Many still had unmet physical and psychological needs and had experienced a sense of loss and devastation which had fundamentally affected their ability to cope, undermining their sense of identity and feelings of self-worth.”\r\n\r\nSeveral anonymous Home Office staff interviewed by Williams also expressed concern about the scheme. One told her: “Our approach does not scream ‘righting the wrongs’ or compassion, but ‘how little can we get away with paying out’.”\r\n\r\nThe Windrush compensation scheme has paid out more than £45m on 993 claims. It has also provided more than 14,800 individuals with documentation confirming their status or British citizenship. However, this is a fraction of the amount originally estimated to be paid out, expected to be between £200m and £390m. At least 23 people have died after submitting a claim, but before receiving any payment.\r\n\r\nAlthough the department has taken steps to introduce a training programme to educate Home Office staff about the legacy of empire and colonialism, only 163 people, out of a total headcount of about 38,000, had visited the Windrush learning hub on its internal intranet system.\r\n\r\nResponding to the report, Patel said: “I have laid the foundations for radical change in the department and a total transformation of culture. We have already made significant progress.\r\n\r\n“Having said that, there is more to do and I will not falter in my commitment to everyone who was affected by the Windrush scandal. Many people suffered terrible injustices at the hands of successive governments and I will continue working hard to deliver a Home Office worthy of every community we serve.”\r\n\r\nThe Windrush victim Anthony Bryan was wrongly held for five weeks in immigration removal centres and was booked in 2017 on a flight back to Jamaica, the country he left when he was eight in 1965 and had not visited since.\r\n\r\nAfter his case was highlighted in the Guardian, officials acknowledged he was in the UK legally. He has still not resolved his claim for compensation, and is appealing against the sum offered to him by the Home Office. “Their offer doesn’t reflect what I went through – it felt like an insult. I don’t think the Home Office has changed; when the spotlight is on them they make promises, but once the public attention moves away nothing happens.”', 'The Home Office has failed to transform its culture or to become a more compassionate department as it promised to do after the Windrush scandal, a critical inspection report has found.\r\n\r\nExpressions of disappointment appear 14 times in the progress report published by independent expert Wendy Williams, who was appointed to advise the Home Office on how to reform to avoid any future crisis.\r\n\r\nReviewing the department’s progress in its commitments to addressing the problems caused by the Windrush scandal, Williams said while officials had been ambitious in some areas she was “disappointed by the lack of tangible progress or drive to achieve the cultural changes required”.', '2022-03-31', '11:27:00', 2, 26),

In total Britain has granted just 25,500 visas to Ukrainian refugees since the start of March, with 22,800 issued to Ukrainians hoping to join relatives in the UK under the Ukraine Family scheme.\r\n\r\nMore than 4 million refugees have left Ukraine, with the vast majority of them settling in Poland, according to the UNHCR. An estimated 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine.\r\n\r\nDozens of people who hoped to bring refugees to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have contacted the Guardian to express frustration at the slowness of the visa granting system. Almost 200,000 people signed up to express interest in hosting refugees.\r\n\r\nApplicants have complained that there is no way to track applications, leaving refugees uncertain about whether to begin travelling to the UK, or to remain in Ukraine. Some people have complained that the online form is badly designed, contains glitches and is difficult to complete if English is not your first language.\r\n\r\nOthers have struggled with the amount of documentation needed, questioning whether it is realistic for people fleeing war zones to have brought bank statements, or other documentary evidence proving they were resident in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nSome people have reported that some family members have been granted visas while others have not, leaving them with difficult decisions about whether to split families as they try to seek safety.\r\n\r\nNumerous potential hosts have contacted the Guardian describing their fears for the safety of refugees they are hoping to host, who are waiting, often in unsuitable accommodation, for visas to be granted.\r\n\r\nThe shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the latest figures reveal “shamefully slow progress on Ukrainian refugees”. Sonya Sceats, chief executive of the Freedom From Torture charity, described the sponsorship scheme numbers as “woeful”, and called on the government to “cut the red tape”.\r\n\r\nLeading refugee charities this week called on the government to waive visas for Ukrainian refugees, as a short-term measure, to bring the UK in line with measures taken by the EU. The Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam said the visa system was “causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians”.\r\n\r\n“Those who want to come to the UK are having to navigate a complex web of bureaucratic paperwork to get visas, leaving them facing protracted delays without any information about the status of their application,” the charity heads wrote.\r\n\r\nLord Harrington, the refugees minister, said changes had been made to the application scheme to try to streamline it, but agreed further improvements were needed.\r\n\r\n“We have not got everything right. It is not as seamless as it should be,” he said, acknowledging that it still took too long to fill out an application.\r\n\r\n\r\n“We are starting to see progress because of changes the Home Office made to streamline the visa process and put additional resources into the system. However, we need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible.” He said he hoped officials would be able to process 15,000 applications a week within the next three weeks.\r\n\r\nAsked whether the government needed to cut the red tape involved in issuing visas, Boris Johnson said Britain had been “overwhelmingly generous”.
